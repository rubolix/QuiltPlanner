## Quilting Math

- **Seam allowance** — Default ¼″, added to all cut dimensions
- **HST** — Cut squares ⅞″ larger than finished size, cut diagonally for 2 triangles
- **Flying Geese** — Large square +1¼″ (yields 4), small corner squares +⅞″
- **Binding** — Strips cut at specified width across WOF, joined for perimeter
- **Backing** — Quilt size + 4″ per side, paneled if wider than WOF
- **Yardage** — Rounded up to nearest ⅛ yard
